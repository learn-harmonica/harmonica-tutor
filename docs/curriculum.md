# Harmonica Tutor – Curriculum (draft)

This curriculum is tuned for 10-hole diatonic harmonicas in keys C, G, and A.

## Stage 0 — Setup, orientation, and habits

- Instrument overview: holes, blow vs draw, basic cleaning/care
- How to hold the harmonica + how to hold/cup hands (tone)
- Breathing basics: relaxed airflow, not “sucking hard”
- Your first sounds: chords vs single notes

## Stage 1 — Single notes and simple music (mostly 1st position)

- Embouchure options:
  - lip pursing (puckering)
  - tongue blocking (single notes + octave/chord options)
- Simple scales and call/response
- Folk melodies and riffs that avoid bends at first

## Stage 2 — Blues foundations (introduce 2nd position)

- 12-bar blues form (I–IV–V) and shuffle feel
- Cross harp / 2nd position concept (e.g., C harp for blues in G)
- Core blues techniques:
  - bends (start with easier bends like 4 draw)
  - vibrato (hand/throat)
  - articulation (slaps, pulls, tongue switching)

## Stage 3 — Expand keys and repertoire

- Use your G and A harps for common blues keys:
  - G harp for key of D (2nd position)
  - A harp for key of E (2nd position)
- Play-along practice with backing tracks
- Start building a personal “set list” of fun tunes

## Stage 4 — Jazz color (optional track)

- Swing phrasing and rhythmic accuracy
- Chord-tone targeting and simple ii–V–I vocabulary
- Optional advanced techniques (careful pacing):
  - overblows/overdraws (for chromaticism on diatonic)

## Daily practice format (10–20 minutes)

- 2 min: warm air / relaxed breathing + long tones
- 5 min: single-note accuracy on a few holes
- 5 min: rhythm pattern (shuffle/swing) with metronome
- 5 min: a riff or small tune + record yourself
